                    I'm Marley Pond, and I've started this site to explore game design, storytelling, and psychology. Specifically, how these topics relate to one another!<br/><br/>
                    
                    I've also designed this site, which I aim to expand consistently with content and a companion podcast! I also have spun up an indie game studio <a href="adeios.com">adeios games</a>. It might be just me at the moment...<br/><br/>

                    If you are interested in getting in touch to discuss freelance work, or to provide feedback and thoughts, please reach out to <a id="contactid"></a> and let me know what's on your mind. I will try to respond in a timely fashion. I am interested in writing poetry, lyrics, and branching narratives. I am also able to help with branding, designing logos and related short-form copy. Give me a shout!<br/><br/>

                    There are big things planned! Branching narrative games, murder mystery kits, and much more.<br/><br/>
