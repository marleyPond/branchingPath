   It is common for horror and thriller genres to be used to frame the main story arc for branching narrative games, as well as other types of adventure and story-driven games. The allure of progressing through a mystery, untangling the interconnected relationships of characters, and the ticking clock that looms over the plot make these kinds of stories mesh especially well with games, as this genre is special in testing out their ability to navigate such situations and see how their decisions fare. The collection of materials and careful navigation of spaces, action, and reaction lend themselves well to the language most natural to games. </br></br>As seen in the progression of music and movies, especially in the last decade, we are seeing a trend where more and more artists are creating art that entangle two or three genres together, moving between them continually in order to create something that is less represented by one category alone. By weaving in the beats and tropes of many genres at once, such as comedy and horror, it can provide intermittent moments of tension and relief, all the while these contrasts playing off of one another. This can keep the experience engaging, and done well, this can enhance the experience, leaving the audience entertained and touched, and removing the fatigue of having constant tension or relying on constant humor. </br></br>It can be difficult to weave genres together in a way that does not seem heavy-handed. If the tone of the humor is off, it can take the gravity away from the story. I would like to discuss a few of my favorite movies briefly in order to explore the blending of genres more fully. A movie that really continues to impress me is Cabin in the Woods. This film is both a critique on the horror genre, and a solid horror film itself. The deft plotting, foreshadowing, and combination of subtle and heavy-handed flags make it extremely impressive to me, with each viewing generally having something new brought to my attention. The horrific situation that the protagonists, and then everyone else, is put in is shocking and terrible, all the while being simultaneously absurd. As the film goes on, it continues to subvert expectations, and the rapid pace that it sometimes flips from shock and gore to comedic beat is surprisingly effective. The film manages to be entertaining, and to leave the audience with a kind of lingering discomfort as it grapples with themes about society and humanity. This could have been a moderate comedy or horror movie, but is elevated by the blending of the two, and becoming simultaneously a love-letter and critique of what it is. </br></br>Happy Death Day is also a film that I would recommend to anyone as a study of masterful genre blending. I would say that this film really embodies three genres, switching less abruptly between comedy, horror, and drama. It has a more individualistic root issue, dealing with the acceptance of the passing of a loved one, and the struggle to control outcomes. I am always fascinated with movies that involve death loops, and they are often evocative of dreams I experience. It is not uncommon for me to die repeatedly, only to be met with the same scenario, and attempt to iterate to achieve a different outcome. By exploring the alternate paths and slowly unraveling the story by reaching different conclusions, movies like this and The Edge Of Tomorrow are close to the early experience with branching narrative books, or with more modern games like TellTale and Supermassive Games, where players are able to see all sides of the plot only if they repeat it, exploring the possibility space. </br></br>The way that Happy Death Day lets itself linger on the comedy, horror, and drama give it a different feel than Cabin in the Woods, and in the end the more measured pacing, the more complex genre juggling, and the more individual core theme explored lend to an overall deeper experience. Some of the most impactful cinema that I have seen involve this kind of blending, such as Psychokinesis and Kung Fu Hustle, which use excellent cinematography, music, and disparate genres to help emphasize and contrast one another. This can lead to an amplification of the experience, and although for those last two movies, the fundamental story structure also has a great deal to do with why it feels so different, this is to a large extent also due to the genre blending.</br></br>Humans understand things in contrast to other things. It is difficult to ascribe value judgment to something unless there is already an anchored thing in mind to contrast it with. Humans are also wired to be sensitive to change, and to connect things together into a story. The blending of experiences may also be closer to how we would expect real experiences to be, reflecting a more nuanced and rich series of events. In real life, there is often humor in the absurdity of horror, or fright in the kernel of a joke. The interplay of these things over the course of a story engages more aspects of a person, and allows greater emersion than if you are stuck in one genre alone, which can be fatiguing. It is also easier to represent a more complex character with a larger palette. </br></br>This applies to games as any other art form, where the juxtaposition can help to explore and flesh out the characters and story more so than abiding by one genre framework, even in the case that there is an upsetting of expectations. While it can be tempting to write a story that fully frees itself from genre expectations, it is useful to still abide by one or two main frameworks, as these beats and outcomes are expected patterns by the audience, for better or for worse. It has been said that you ought learn the rules, and only then break them. I feel like this makes sense, and in understanding why and how certain things fit in with and affect the whole, it is then that you can understand the impact of violating this rule, and use it to an end. </br></br>The exploration and player agency that games inherently involve make for an excellent addition to the opportunities afforded by mixing genres together. Not only is it a way to allow for the shared pacing control and relief of players by allowing tonal shifts that do not run counter to the overall whole, but it makes for more rich experiences by opening up the ways in which actions and conversations may be approached and explored. When done right, this kind of thing blends into the background, leaving the experience standing alone, and providing engagement that a single genre alone cannot. Playing through a certain kind of game, it is more difficult to separate yourself from the well-traveled genre path and become immersed in it. And with more flexibility to place tonal switching into the players control, you can more readily provide an experience suited to their whims and preference. </br></br>With the possibilities and tones fluctuating with the circumstance, it provides relief from the strange pacing problems that games encounter, especially with conversational patterns, and the dynamic aspects and weaving beats provide cover for the otherwise predictable occurrences. It is these aspects along with the contrast and amplification that certain genres may provide one another that really advance these kinds of works to be greater than a single genre may muster. As in movies, music, and many other art forms, games are coming to breach the confines of single genres and rest in many, and they are richer experiences for it. </br></br>
