   There has been a long tradition of players being able to collect equipment and don garments as they progress through an adventure. Especially in relation to RPG's and adventure games, clothes have come to be an integral part in forming the progression and engagement of the experience. It has always been interesting to me, the manner in which these kinds of games are able to distill things into mathematical representations that correlate to some extent with their real-life counterpart. I've discussed already the negative aspects of reducing things and laying them bare to the player, such as simplistic relationship mechanics, with one or a few variables ticking upward based on a static function comprises the bulk of the system. Depending on the results you want, this approach can be fine, I'm just interested in exploring and pushing against these kinds of things that are ubiquitous and worth questioning for your project. </br></br>Besides my qualms with iterative systems, there is no doubt that to some extent they are effective. Not only is it satisfying to watch your character progress in their many stats, and to see that effect translated into greater impact in the game world, but it does eloquently capture the feeling of skill improvement and experience over time in real life. When learning a new skill, it is more evident when you make advances early on. As you progress, the benchmarks on which you measure your progress become further and far between, as it becomes more difficult to make meaningful progress. It requires more experience to improve when you already know and are practiced in something. This system does do a good job of marrying progression in things over time with the rewarding improvement at intervals that is appealing to our minds.</br></br>I used to think it was strange that by donning a kind of clothing in an RPG, it would give you a boost in charisma, or make you more intelligent. I would express the desire that the real world has such a garment, so that I may enjoy those advantages. This is really just another reflection of how the world really is. There have been studies (that I am going to allude to but not state) exploring the impact of things like writing tests in different kinds of clothing, or in how people perform on given tasks when they wear clothing that is either more or less appropriate from their perspective. People are given to linking things together, and context is important in understanding things, and in the formation of expectation. People are impacted by the clothing they wear, and based on generalizations and associations, just wearing a piece of clothing in a context that is perceived as appropriate or inappropriate can translate to real-life buffs or debuffs in relevant performance.</br></br>Going back to game design, there is of course more exaggerated representation of this. When one can equip a piece of clothing and gain the ability to teleport it is pretty far removed from being able to move more quietly through the environment. What about clothing that alters the appearance of your character? I have chosen to keep clothing that I find is more pleasing to me than clothing that has more benefits but seems like an aesthetic downgrade. That being said, I am more interested in story than in victory, and I know that is going to run against the grain for some people. But in a strategy game, I'm very pleased when my traveling cryptid zoo is crushed by a rival summoning an erupting volcano nearby. Games have always been judged just as much by style as mechanics, and rightly so. As beings who are extremely visual, it makes sense that we would put so much weight on the appearance of things.</br></br>The appearance alters the experience; the same scene can play out in extremely different manners with nothing but a clothing swap. This gives players the opportunity to express themselves, either by making their character more relatable to themselves, approaching something more like the character they are envisioning in their heads, or even to twist the story into something that the developers may not have intended. A horror may be turned into a comedy, or a drama into a satire. </br></br>The juxtaposition of many clothing arcs over time between their benefits and their relative functionality as would translate to real life is generally pretty jarring at first glance.  It is a tendency in RPG's for equipment to become less wieldy, less functional, and more glamorous. This makes sense if we look at it from an experiential standpoint. The journey is not about the accrual of wealth and the possession of things in a direct sense. The escalating pathway to more glamorous and brash attire is more about the increasing confidence and capability reflected back to the player. The story arc is someone, incapable and in a world full of danger, coming into their own, developing a varied set of skills, and being able to handle both known and unknown threats. This is something that I will dive into later, as I don't want to go off on too much of a tangent. But the relationship between equipment, capabilities, and confidence are what is really being portrayed here.</br></br>The more powerful the character, the more suave and effortless they seem. The mercenary who does not resemble their companions and dresses like a commoner, or the commoner in the garb of a knight are both strong ways to grab the attention of the player. There is an expectation that someone dressed to the nines in armor, or someone wearing rags, would have certain abilities and means. The hapless armored person or the Homeless Level 900 Wizard (shout out to The Salt Factory) are more impactful than an encounter with a capable, armored person or a vulnerable person lacking resources. </br></br>We can see this in contrast of how the player characters are viewed. As I gain more capabilities and experience, I look more stylish and relaxed; as I face more difficult foes, they appear more well-equipped and menacing. This seems to be a reflection once again to a common heuristic used to understand oneself and others in the real world. The Fundamental Attribution Error is the idea that when you are making sense of a negative action that you have done, it is due to the circumstance. When another person does the same thing, it is due to their character. This tendency can be reversed in positive circumstances. There is an inherent divide in how we understand ourselves and how we understand others, and this stems from the knowledge and context  disparity available in evaluating ourselves and others behaviors. This also makes sense in the role of familiarity, and the tendency to take a positive or negative starting point in viewing the actions of others. The equal and opposite clothing pathway seen in many games can be seen as a reflection of the players growing confidence and capability, and the seriousness in which they are being taken.</br></br>In the beginning, the player is barely able to handle the things directly outside of their place where they reside. By the end, they are traveling to the ends of the earth to destroy the most fearsome being in existence. And yet, without their equipment, they are likely helpless in accomplishing their task. Despite the growth that is not related to their increasing items, a good deal of their success relies heavily on having the appropriate equipment, and in continuing to seek it out. This links back to the impact of perception and capability nicely. Even though we understand how far the hero has come, with all the experience gained and abilities learned, there is still a reliance on expectation and external anchors to enable their success. If they go into battle wearing the shirt they started in far from their home, it is likely going to be a very dire situation. This won't usually happen, as these things are discarded once they are no longer relevant, just as it is natural to outgrow a previously adopted solution, abandoning it for something better. At the same time, collecting something that would grant benefits far outside of what you are prepared for, you are generally not able to equip. You don't have the experience or requisite skills to don this item. </br></br>If I was to wear the uniform of a doctor, or of a police officer, I would feel extremely uncomfortable. I do not have the skills or experience in order to wear a uniform with such authority, or to wield the tools of their trade. There is a lot to explore behind the design of clothing, appearance, and impact of these things on how a game is experienced. Without factoring this into the design of our games, we are rolling the dice with a meaningful portion of it. </br></br>
